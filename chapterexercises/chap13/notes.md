# Objects of vectors

## 13.1
- Enumeration is a distinct type whos value is restricted to a certain set of values
- defult first enumerated type maps to 0, 2nd to 1, then so on
- put enum defintions in the .h file
- instance variable rank and suit can be declared with type Rank and Suit
- cant do arithmetic with enumerated types

## 13.2
- Switch statement is when you want different actions to occur based on spefic values of an evaluated expression
- good style to include a default case in every switch statement

## 13.3
- Instance variable name is cards to help tell the difference the deck object from the vector of cards.

## 13.6 
- "A better shuffling algorithm is to traverse the deck on card at a time, and at each iteration choose two cards and swap them."

## 13.7
- Pseudocode helps with the design of helper functions
- A helper function is a function that is not a member of a class but assists in the functionality of that class or another part of your program

## 13.8
- Deck constructer dosent initalize the cards
- Vector memeber functions push back and pop back
- Push back: Adds new element to the end
- Pop back: Removes last element in the vector

## 13.10
- Merge sort: An algorithm for sorting a collection of values
